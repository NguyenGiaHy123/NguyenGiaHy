Problem 1: Summation Function

This problem requires implementing sum_to_n(n), which calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to n.

Implementations:

Iterative Approach (Loop-based)

Uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to n and accumulate the sum.

Time Complexity: O(n)

Mathematical Formula (Gauss' Formula)

Uses the formula: sum_to_n(n) = (n * (n + 1)) / 2.

Time Complexity: O(1) (Constant time)

Recursive Approach

Calls itself recursively until n reaches 1.

Time Complexity: O(n) (Recursive depth)

Problem 2: Currency Swap Form

A user-friendly currency exchange form allowing users to swap assets between different currencies.

Features:

Real-time Exchange Rates - Fetches live token prices from Switcheo API.‚úÖ Intuitive UI/UX - Modern, user-friendly design with validation and error handling.‚úÖ Fast Performance - Built with Vite for optimized frontend experience.

 Problem 3: ReactJS Code Optimization

Identified Inefficiencies & Anti-patterns:

Unnecessary Re-renders - Using state where a simple variable is sufficient.‚ùå Inefficient use of useEffect - Fetching data without proper dependency handling.‚ùå Direct State Mutation - Modifying state directly instead of using React‚Äôs setter functions.

Refactored Code Improvements:

React.memo & useCallback - Prevents unnecessary re-renders.‚úÖ Optimized useEffect - Uses correct dependencies to avoid infinite loops.‚úÖ TypeScript Best Practices - Ensures better type safety and maintainability.
